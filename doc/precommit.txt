Some other quite useful ones that are more situation-specific:

check-json - if you have JSON files in your repo
check-merge-conflict - useful if you often rebase/merge
check-symlinks and destroyed-symlinks - very helpful if there’s symlinks checked in to the index
check-vcs-permalinks - particularly useful if there’s a lot of documentation files tracked
file-contents-sorter - if there are files that benefit from a reliable ordering, this is a handy hook
